**Overview**

My name is Seth White, I am currently a graduate student at Grand Valley State University in West Michigan. I recieved my bachelors degree from calvin college and worked as a mechanical engineer in developing HVAC systems for commercial buildings, primarily for Higher education facilities and then multi-Family housing. I am transitioning to the Data Science and Analytics field as I found the data analysis and modeling portions in my engineering field to be the most interesting. I want to spend my working career solving interesting problems and I think Data science will be great avenue to find interesting problems to solve. My currents interests are data analyis and visualization with R, Python and SAS and developing shiny apps and static sites with R to host projects I have completed.
